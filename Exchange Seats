Problem: Write an SQL query to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. 
If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.
Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

Code: 

SELECT id,
    CASE WHEN id%2 = 0 THEN (LAG(student) OVER (ORDER BY id))
ELSE IFNULL(LEAD(student) OVER (ORDER BY id),student)
END as "student"
FROM Seat


Output: 

| id | student |
| -- | ------- |
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
