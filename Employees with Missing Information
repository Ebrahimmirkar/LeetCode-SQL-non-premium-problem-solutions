Problem: Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all the employees with missing information. The information of an employee is missing if:
•	The employee's name is missing, or
•	The employee's salary is missing.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

Code: 

Select COALESCE(e.employee_id, s.employee_id) as employee_id
From Employees AS e
FULL OUTER JOIN Salaries AS s
ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
Where e.name is NULL OR s.salary is NULL
Order by employee_id asc

Output: 

| employee_id |
| ----------- |
| 1           |
| 2           |
