Problem: Write an SQL query to report the name and balance of users with a balance higher than 10000. The balance of an account is equal to the sum of the amounts of all transactions involving that account.
Return the result table in any order.

SELECT U.NAME, SUM(T.AMOUNT) AS BALANCE
FROM USERS AS U 
LEFT JOIN TRANSACTIONS AS T 
ON U.ACCOUNT = T.ACCOUNT GROUP BY T.ACCOUNT
HAVING SUM(T.AMOUNT) > 10000


Output: 

| NAME  | BALANCE |
