Problem: Write an SQL query to rearrange the Products table so that each row has (product_id, store, price). If a product is not available in a store, do not include a row with that product_id and store combination in the result table.
Return the result table in any order.


Code: 

SELECT product_id, 'store1' as store, store1 AS price FROM products
WHERE store1 IS NOT NULL
UNION
SELECT product_id, 'store2' as store, store2 AS price FROM products
WHERE store2 IS NOT NULL
UNION
SELECT product_id, 'store3' as store, store3 AS price FROM products
WHERE store3 IS NOT NULL


Output: 

| product_id | store  | price |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- |
| 0          | store1 | 95    |
| 1          | store1 | 70    |
| 0          | store2 | 100   |
| 0          | store3 | 105   |
| 1          | store3 | 80    |
