Problem: A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.
Write an SQL query to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.
Return the result table in any order.

Code: 

select d.Name Department, e1.Name Employee, e1.Salary
from Employee e1 
join Department d
on e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
where (select count(distinct(e2.Salary)) 
                  from Employee e2 
                  where e2.Salary > e1.Salary 
                  and e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
                  ) < 3;

| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
