Problem: Write an SQL query to report the distance traveled by each user.
Return the result table ordered by travelled_distancein descending order, if two or more users traveled the same distance, order them by their name in ascending order.


Code: 

SELECT U.NAME,
    SUM(
        IF(DISTANCE IS NULL,0,DISTANCE)
        ) 
            AS TRAVELLED_DISTANCE
FROM USERS AS U
LEFT JOIN RIDES AS R
ON U.ID = R.USER_ID
GROUP BY U.ID
ORDER BY TRAVELLED_DISTANCE DESC, U.NAME ASC


Output:

| NAME     | TRAVELLED_DISTANCE |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |
