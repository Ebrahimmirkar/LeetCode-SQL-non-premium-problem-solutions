Problem: Each node in the tree can be one of three types:
•	"Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
•	"Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
•	"Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.
Return the result table in any order.

Code: 

SELECT ID, 
    CASE 
 WHEN P_ID IS NULL THEN 'Root'
WHEN ID IN (SELECT P_ID FROM TREE) THEN 'Inner' ELSE 'Leaf'
END AS Type
FROM TREE
ORDER BY ID


Output: 

| ID | Type  |
| -- | ----- |
| 1  | Root  |
| 2  | Inner |
| 3  | Leaf  |
| 4  | Leaf  |
| 5  | Leaf  |
