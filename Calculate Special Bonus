Problem: Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

Code: 


SELECT 
    employee_id, 
    CASE WHEN 
        employee_id % 2 != 0
        and Name not like 'M%'
        then salary 
else 0
        end as Bonus
from employees
order by employee_id 

Output: 

| employee_id | Bonus |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |
