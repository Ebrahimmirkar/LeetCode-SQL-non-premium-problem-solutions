Problem: Write an SQL query to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase, and the rest are lowercase.
Return the result table ordered by user_id.

Code: 

SELECT USERS.USER_ID, CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTRING(USERS.NAME,1,1)),LOWER(SUBSTRING(NAME,2))) AS NAME
FROM USERS
GROUP BY USER_ID
ORDER BY USER_ID ASC


Output: 

| USER_ID | NAME  |
| ------- | ----- |
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |
