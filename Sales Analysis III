Problem: Write an SQL query that reports the products that were only sold in the first quarter of 2019. That is, between 2019-01-01 and 2019-03-31 inclusive.
Return the result table in any order.

Code:

SELECT DISTINCT P.PRODUCT_ID, P.PRODUCT_NAME 
FROM PRODUCT AS P 
JOIN SALES AS S 
    ON S.PRODUCT_ID = P.PRODUCT_ID
    WHERE P.PRODUCT_ID NOT IN 
         (SELECT S.PRODUCT_ID FROM SALES AS S 
            WHERE S.SALE_DATE NOT  BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31')


Output: 

| PRODUCT_ID | PRODUCT_NAME |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 1          | S8           |
